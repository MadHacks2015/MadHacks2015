        <h2>About</h2>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>MadHacks 2015 is UW-Madison's first intercollegiate hackathon. Come
            make history with 500 of your peers in one of the Midwest's greatest
            collaborative events this spring.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>Opening ceremonies will commence at 5pm on April 17th and project
            demos will conclude by noon on April 19.</p>

        <h3>Where</h3>
        <p>MadHacks will be hosted at 605 Science Drive, Madison, WI.</p>

        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>You! If you're a student at a US college, you should apply to
            MadHacks to come show off your talents!</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>You'll spend 36 hours hacking on a new project in teams of 1-4.
            After projects have been completed, you'll demo your project to
            the other hackers. May the maddest project win!

            <h3>What's a Hackathon?</h3>
            <p>If you've never had the pleasure of attending a hackathon before,
            our friends and sponsors at Major League Hacking have put together a
                great <a href="https://mlh.io/about">intro</a> about what a
                hackathon is and why you should attend one!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="overlayBlock">
            <h3>What makes MadHacks different?</h3>
            <p>Unlike other hackathons, MadHacks is going to be putting
                emphasis on the wacky, the original, and the downright
                impossible! Like the mad-genius computer scientists before
                us, we want to test our boundaries like never before! We're
                reaching out to the highly dedicated risk-takers, the
                envelope pushers, and the daredevils. We hope to produce a
                new kind of hackathon: where the winners are chosen by the
                hackers, and the sponsors feel like they are right in the
                middle of the hacker community itself - rather than on
                the outside looking in.</p>

                <p>We're waiting for everyone to sign up to get a feel for the
                    transport demand. It's likely that we'll be sending buses along
                    the major routes for nearby (Midwest) colleges. If you don't
                    wind up with a bus, we'll reimburse up to $50 in travelling
                    expenses per person (can you say carpool party anyone?).

                <p>Whatever you need to make your hack a success! For most
                    people, this means a laptop, charger, smartphone, and your
                    friends! Optional but nice things include a pillow, a change
                    of clothes, and a toothbrush and toothpaste. Please don't
                    bring anything you wouldn't take on a school field trip - no
                    drugs or weapons.

        <h2>About</h2>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>MadHacks 2015 is UW-Madison's first intercollegiate national
            hackathon. Come make history with 300 of your peers
            in one of the Midwest's greatest
            collaborative events this spring.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>Opening ceremonies will commence the evening of April 17th and
            project demos will conclude in the afternoon on April 19.</p>

        <h3>Where</h3>
        <p>MadHacks will be hosted at 605 Science Drive, Madison, WI.</p>

        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>You! If you're 18+ and in school, you should apply to  MadHacks to
            come showcase your talents! Students of all backgrounds and skill
            levels are welcome!</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>You'll spend 36 hours hacking on a new project in teams of 1-4.
            At the end of it all, you'll demo your project to
            the other hackers. In the meantime, you'll have free food,
            enjoy activities such as: a costume contest, dance competition,
            and gaming in our dedicated leisure lounge; meet
            wonderful sponsors, and make lifelong
            friends. May the maddest project win!

            <h3>What's a Hackathon?</h3>
            <p>If you've never had the pleasure of attending a hackathon before,
            our friends at Major League Hacking have put together a
                great <a href="https://mlh.io/about">intro</a> about what a
                hackathon is and why you should attend one!</p>
            <p>Be sure to review the <a
                    href="http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">
                MLH code of conduct</a> to know what to expect at MadHacks!

        <div class="overlayBlock">
            <h3>What makes MadHacks different?</h3>
            <p>Unlike other hackathons, MadHacks is going to be putting
                emphasis on the wacky, the original, and the downright
                impossible! Like the mad genius computer scientists preceeding
                us, we want to test our boundaries like never before! We're
                reaching out to the highly dedicated risk-takers, the
                envelope pushers, and the daredevils. We hope to produce a
                new kind of hackathon: where the winners are chosen by the
                hackers, and the sponsors feel like they are right in the
                middle of the hacker community itself &mdash; rather than on
                the outside looking in.</p>

                    routes and reimbursements will be dependent on demand. It's
